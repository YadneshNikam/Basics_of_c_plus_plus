Experiment 1: C++ Program Structure, Installation, and First Program
Aim:
To learn how to install a C++ development environment (VS Code and compiler), understand the basic structure of a C++ program, and implement simple programs like "Hello World" and a basic calculator.

Tools:
VScode

Theory:
C++ is a widely-used programming language for developing efficient and high-performance applications. Before writing C++ programs, a proper development environment must be set up, including an editor (like Visual Studio Code) and a compiler (such as GCC via MinGW-w64).

The basic structure of a C++ program includes:

Header files: Added at the top (e.g., <iostream>) to provide necessary functionalities.

Namespace: using namespace std; is commonly used to avoid prefixing standard library names with std::.

Main function: The entry point of every C++ program is int main().

Statements and Output: Statements within the main function (such as cout) perform actions like outputting text.

Understanding how to write, compile, and execute simple programs—such as displaying a message ("Hello World") or calculating the sum of two numbers (Calculator)—lays the foundation for learning C++.

Conclusion:
This experiment familiarized us with setting up the C++ environment, explored the structure of a C++ program, and implemented basic programs. These fundamentals form the basis for writing, understanding, and executing more complex C++ applications in future experiments.
