 Experiment 3: Arithmetic, Relational & Logical Operators in C++
 Aim:
To study and apply arithmetic, relational, and logical operators in C++ to perform mathematical operations and conditional evaluations.

Tools:
VScode

Theory:
Arithmetic Operators perform basic mathematical operations such as +, -, *, /, %, and include increment (++) and decrement (--).

Relational Operators are used to compare two values. Operators include: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

Logical Operators evaluate multiple conditions:

1-&& (Logical AND)

2-|| (Logical OR)

3-! (Logical NOT)

These operators are commonly used in control flow structures like if, while, and for statements.
 
Conclusion:
Understanding arithmetic, relational, and logical operators allows programmers to build effective logic based on numerical and boolean conditions, forming the foundation of program decision-making in C++.
