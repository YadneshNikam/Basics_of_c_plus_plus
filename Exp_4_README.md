Experiment 4: Bitwise and Assignment Operators in C++
Aim:
To study and implement bitwise and assignment operators in C++ to manipulate data at the bit level and perform compound operations.

Tools:
VScode

Theory:
Bitwise Operators operate at the binary level:
& (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), << (left shift), >> (right shift).
These are used in low-level programming and hardware interaction.

Assignment Operators assign or update values:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=.
These combine basic operations with assignment for efficiency.

Miscellaneous Operators include:
sizeof, ?: (ternary), , (comma), . and -> (member access), casting, pointer operators & and *.

Conclusion:
Bitwise and assignment operators are essential for efficient memory-level data processing and updating variable values with minimal code. Mastering these operators enhances performance in system-level applications.

Algorithma:
Program 1 (Bitwise AND and OR Operations)
1.Start
2.Declare integer variables for two numbers and two results.
3.Prompt the user to input the first number and store it.
4.Prompt the user to input the second number and store it.
5.Perform bitwise AND operation on the two numbers; store the result.
6.Display the result of the bitwise AND operation.
7.Perform bitwise OR operation on the two numbers; store the result.
8.Display the result of the bitwise OR operation.
9.End

 Program 2 (All Major Bitwise Operators)
1.Start
2.Declare two integer variables and variables for each bitwise result.
3.Assign values to the two integers (e.g., a = 5, b = 3).
4.Perform and store the following operations:
Bitwise AND (a & b)
Bitwise OR (a | b)
Bitwise XOR (a ^ b)
Bitwise NOT (~a)
Bitwise left shift (a << 2)
Bitwise right shift (a >> 1)
5.Display the results of each operation (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift).
6.End
