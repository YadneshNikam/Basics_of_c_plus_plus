Experiment 4: Bitwise and Assignment Operators in C++
Aim:
To study and implement bitwise and assignment operators in C++ to manipulate data at the bit level and perform compound operations.

Tools:
VScode

Theory:
Bitwise Operators operate at the binary level:
& (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), << (left shift), >> (right shift).
These are used in low-level programming and hardware interaction.

Assignment Operators assign or update values:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=.
These combine basic operations with assignment for efficiency.

Miscellaneous Operators include:
sizeof, ?: (ternary), , (comma), . and -> (member access), casting, pointer operators & and *.

Conclusion:
Bitwise and assignment operators are essential for efficient memory-level data processing and updating variable values with minimal code. Mastering these operators enhances performance in system-level applications.
